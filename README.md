# Raw MS Data

1. 122922.13c-unlabeled: Lipidomic analysis of unlabaled N- and SuHx-MVECs. These data formed the basis for the volcano plot shown in Figure 2

2. 13c palm comps - 24h_raw: Raw data for unlabeled and 13c-labeled N- and SuHx where palmitate incubation was performed for 24h. As described in the paper, this experiment featured a higher dose (0.3mM) of palmitate for a shorter period of time. There was some concern for toxicity, so this experiment was repeated with 0.15mM at 48h. 

3. 13 palm comps - 48h_raw: This is the raw data for the experiment whose results were featured in the manuscript - 0.15mM palm loading for 48h.
